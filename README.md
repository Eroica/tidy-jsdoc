# Tidy 

A JSDoc3 template

Documentation doesn't have to be ugly and boring.

![Theme Preview](./images/jsdoc-theme-view.png)

Based on the default JSDoc 3 template, which uses: 
- [the Taffy Database library](http://taffydb.com/)
- [Underscore Template library](http://underscorejs.org/).

## Work in Progress

_(Last updated 26 May 2017)_

Currently just for my use. I intend on eventually publishing this. But I would need to clean up many templates first. The default `publish.js` and underscore templates are hairy. But _done is better than perfect._
